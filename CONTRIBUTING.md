   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Or build directly with go
go build -o gswarm ./cmd/gswarm
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Code Quality

make fmt

# Run linter
make lint
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Use meaningful variable and function names
