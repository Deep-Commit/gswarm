# GSwarm Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for GSwarm, a **third-party** Go-based supervisor for Gensyn RL Swarm that provides automatic restart capabilities, dependency management, and comprehensive logging. GSwarm is **not part of the official Gensyn team** and operates as an independent tool to enhance the user experience of running RL Swarm.

**Important Note**: GSwarm is a supervisor/wrapper around the official Gensyn RL Swarm application. We cannot modify the core RL Swarm functionality, training algorithms, or blockchain integration. Our scope is limited to:
- Process management and supervision
- Environment setup and dependency management
- Monitoring and logging
- Configuration management
- User experience improvements

## Current Status (Q3 2025)

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Core Process Management**: Automatic restart capabilities with exponential backoff
- **Dependency Management**: Python environment setup and requirements installation
- **Modal Login Integration**: Automated blockchain identity management (uses existing modal-login)
- **Configuration Management**: Interactive and command-line configuration modes
- **Basic Logging**: Comprehensive logging with timestamps and process tracking
- **Cross-platform Support**: macOS, Linux, and Windows compatibility
- **Error Detection**: Pattern-based error detection and recovery
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown and cleanup

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics collection
- **Configuration Profiles**: Save/load configuration presets
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Intelligent error classification and recovery

### ðŸš« Out of Scope (Core RL Swarm Features)
- Training algorithm modifications
- Blockchain smart contract changes
- Model architecture changes
- Core hivemind functionality
- Official Gensyn protocol modifications
