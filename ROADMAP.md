# GSwarm Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for GSwarm, a **third-party** Go-based supervisor for Gensyn RL Swarm that provides automatic restart capabilities, dependency management, and comprehensive logging. GSwarm is **not part of the official Gensyn team** and operates as an independent tool to enhance the user experience of running RL Swarm.

**Important Note**: GSwarm is a supervisor/wrapper around the official Gensyn RL Swarm application. We cannot modify the core RL Swarm functionality, training algorithms, or blockchain integration. Our scope is limited to:
- Process management and supervision
- Environment setup and dependency management
- Monitoring and logging
- Configuration management
- User experience improvements
